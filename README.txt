To run this you must have Java installed.
Use a code IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, to compile/run the code.


Note:

If you try to run this and the images for the characters do not load,
most likely you will have to change the code that references the image file names
to the direct file location.

For example: 
(Paper.java)
	"images\\paper pixel.png" 
		    v
"C:\\Users\\Andre\\Documents\\Coding\\VSCODE Projects\\RPS\\images\\paper pixel.png"

Obviously this exact file location will depend on where you decide to download
the game's folder and files.
